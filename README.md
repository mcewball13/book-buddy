## Refactor

> I added a `refactor` branch with some updated codeto show how I would have done it if I had more time. I spent about 45 min on Sunday to do it.

- I would have used a context to store the search state and a custom hook to update the state.
- I would have used a custom Layout component to handle the navigation.
- I would have better organized the components.
